# Government Regulated Price Hike Application

Background to the Problem
Bangladesh is a country of prosperity where agriculture is the backbone of its Economy.
So, it is safe to assume that there should not be any hassle for anything in the market,
especially food related products. Surprisingly, the market does not support this statement
as we face severe price hike problem in our daily life. The government provides
statistical data about our own growing food staffs which does not reflect in the market
and some inside people work which results in the price hike.
One of the main problems of price hike in our country is syndicates. The essentials are
stocked, which raises market demand, after which the price is raised, and the essentials
are made available. That is why the price keeps changing as per their wish, not under the
surveillance of government. It is a huge problem for consumers as they cannot predict
their marketing target to buy foods and people of lower, middle class are the main
sufferers with the students who are trying to study and make living. Bangladesh being a
under development country, those people play a vital role in running the economy of this
country. So, we must think the involvement of government surveillance is crucial to this

problem else the country economy will fall as majority of people will fail to lead their
daily lives.


Solution to the Problem
Our project objective is to propose a technology-based solution to minimize price hike
problems in the market. The proposed approach introduces a government-regulated app
system that aims to monitor and control the prices of essential commodities in the market.
We are aiming to make a web-based application to deal with this problem. We know that
our country has secured the signal tower throughout most of the area and soon rural areas
will be covered. That is why we chose this application to be web based so anybody with
the access of internet can use this product. The application will provide real time updated
prices of the product commissioned by the government which results Consumers who
want to buy anything he/she needs, can have a gist idea of how much would it cost, or
he/she can decide that what is the priority to buy for the day as per earning. Government
can also take measures to how the market is evolving- what is it need. So, they can
analyze the market to observe any anomalies like syndicates are involved or not and can
catch the threat easily. The application will be very light and does not require vastly
invested money. As the application will be web based so all it would require software and
servers which is already being used by the government, only to have access to the
government database. So, it is feasible to meet business needs also.
This application was planned to keep in mind the idea about ensuring affordability of
essential goods and to solve the challenges related to price hike. We made sure that there
is a collaboration between consumers and government so that the sellers cannot explicitly
do anything which would result in bad circumstances. Here are those:
1. Real time Monitoring:
Our application would use information about sellers, shops, retailers, and the
marketplaces to analyze, and provide us with the whole picture of how things are getting
managed from everywhere. It also helps to point out if there is any sudden increase of
price or anything that hampers the equilibrium of balance.
2. Price Diversion Analysis:
Based on the analyzed data it could help us to fix prices depending on the geographical
position, condition and other factors-this would help government to predict the potential
price hike and resist the other occurrences. The government will have the license/trade
number of all shops, so it will be easy for them to track them for any purpose also
consumers will have to use their National ID number to make any report or complaints
about shops.
3. Visualization:
This application visualizes the data of how the market is at. All trends, changes and price
hotspots information gathered to help the policy makers imbue better strategies to
overcome price hike. Consumers can see the Manufacture date (Mfg.) and Expire dates
(Exp.) to have through information about its health safety issue which would enable them
to pick their items as well as making sure its heathy. This also enables the consumers to
perceive their marketing decisions better, with the user-friendly interface they can also
compare the product price and other facilities to have proper idea.
4. Collaboration:
Our main goal is to make an alliance between government and consumers. Through this
application consumers can report if they face any difficulty while buying any product and
the government can investigate the matter more thoroughly. The authority can inspect
better. This application will enable a huge impact on the whole population as they will
learn the culture of using internet for their day-to-day needs. Government also can have
people opinion about their next plan regarding price or any suggestion they can get to
upgrade their evaluation of this system. It provides a centralized platform for sharing
information, coordinating efforts, and generating comprehensive reports on price trends,
regulatory compliance, and consumer complaints.
This solution has the potential to produce fair pricing while protecting consumer interest
with the empowerment of social economic stability.
The target group of users of our solution is lower-class, middle-class and students as
these are most of our population. Through this application, they will have a wholistic idea
about how should be their daily marketing. They will know what is more important to
them rather than wasting money buying unnecessarily.
The Application makes a significant contribution to the development of scientific results
by integrating advanced data analysis techniques, predictive modeling, and policy
recommendations. It enhances our understanding of price dynamics and provides
valuable insights to policymakers, economists, and researchers, ultimately leading to
more effective price regulation and stabilization measures.
